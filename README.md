### About

This is a **BOSH-release** add-on for **Logsearch** tool. It extends base **ELK** stack, which provides Logsearch, to work with **CloudFoundry** logs.

So, If you have CloudFoundry deployment and want to make logs management with ELK stack then you choose right product to use. Out-of-the box youâ€™ll get **retrieving and parsing logs** from your CloudFoundry platform, **authorized access** to these logs in Kibana and useful **dashboards and search queries** to start your log analysis with.
